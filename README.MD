# Practice the use of passport with session based authentication

In this project we will practice the use of passport. 
The project is the same as the livecoding project, but some parts are missing. 
Complete the parts and make it work :) 
The goal is mostly that you can recover the missing pieces and see how they are working together.

## What you will be doing

This project will allow you to practise using:

> - Session authentication using passport
> - MVC Pattern

This project assumes you've already had experience with:

> - Routing Express
> - CRUD Operations
> - MongoDB Schemas
> - Using Schema references

## Tasks

Before starting install all the node modules using `npm install`


## Task 1 - Set up the database 
1. Create a new `.env` file 
2. Copy the items from `.env.example` to .env and fill in the values to connect to the database. 


## Task 2 - Complete the missing pieces, make sure the following is possible: 
 - Registering a new user in the database
 - Signing in an existing user using Passport with a local strategy
 - Signing out a user 

### Optional
 - Create middleware to protect a route
 - Create middleware when user is authenticated and should not have access to the `login` routes and the `register routes`.


# Bonus: 
You can style the ejs pages the way you like.
